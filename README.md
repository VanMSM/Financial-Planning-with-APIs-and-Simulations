Financial Planning Project with APIs and Simulations

The project is a sample prototype application tool to help credit union members evaluate their financial health. Specifically, they are able to assess their monthly budgets. Second, the are able to forecast a reasonably effective retirement plan based on their current holdings of cryptocurrencies, stocks, and bonds. 

Part One: 

A financial planner for emergencies. The members will be able to use this tool to visualize their current savings. The members can then determine if they have enough reserves for an emergency fund.

Part Two:

A financial planner for retirement. This tool will forecast the performance of their retirement portfolio in 30 years. To do this, the tool will make an Alpaca API call via the Alpaca SDK to get historical price data for use in Monte Carlo simulations.
